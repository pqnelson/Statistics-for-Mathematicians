# Introduction

This is my feeble attempt to present "Statistics for
Mathematicians". Really, the collection of notes is written targetting
myself.

So far, they consist of a collection of notes on probability
theory. I'll branch out, eventually, absorbing statistics topic by
topic.

Unfortunately, statistics -- unlike pure mathematics -- boils down to a
collection of tools which one gleams by studying many examples. (For
what its worth, probability theory amounts to very much the same.)
Consequently, we must study examples!

I try to use problems that are interesting to me, and I attempt to cite
the source of the problems otherwise.
