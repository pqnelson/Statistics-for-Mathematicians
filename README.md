# Introduction

This is my feeble attempt to present "Statistics for
Mathematicians". Really, the collection of notes is written targetting
myself.

So far, they consist of a collection of notes on probability
theory. I'll branch out, eventually, absorbing statistics topic by
topic.

Unfortunately, statistics -- unlike pure mathematics -- boils down to a
collection of tools which one gleams by studying many examples. (For
what its worth, probability theory amounts to very much the same.)
Consequently, we must study examples!

## Outline

The basic roadmap will be to first tackle the probability
directory. Really we need to get to random variables, the notion of
covariance, and so on.

From there, we can get into statistics. In an Aristotlean sense,
statistics is an art: it's a collection of tools to analyze data. The
"right" questions we should ask, when starting any statistical analysis,
should be:

- What kind and how much data need to be collected?
- How should we organize and summarize the data?
- How can we analyse the data and draw conclusions from it?
- How can we assess the strength of the conclusions and evaluate their unvertainty?

The tools statistics provides could be classified as three "families":

1. **Design:** Planning & carrying out research studies
2. **Description:** Summarizing & exploring data
3. **Inference:** Making predictions & generalizing about phenomena
   based on data.

Since this is a book directed at pure mathematicians (i.e., me), we
won't focus too much on design.

## How to Read This

Eventually, I'll turn these IPython Notebooks into LaTeX, and provide
the TeX sources & binary pdf. Until then, you'll have to read the
IPython notebooks.

I suggest working out the examples for yourself. That's the best (and
only) way to learn probability theory.

For statistics, it's probably good if you have a data set or two at your
disposal. As new concepts come about, try applying them to your data
set. If you don't know where to find data sets,
[UC Irvine](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) has a strong Machine
Learning department with free data sets.

The exercises provided sometimes include the answers, sometimes not. In
either case, before reading on, try solving them.

Puzzles are intended for the reader to mull over before reading
on.
